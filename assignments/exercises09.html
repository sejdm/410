<ol type="1">
<li>Realize the torus as a simplicial complex, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Find subcomplexes <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(|K_1|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|K_2|\)</span> are the cylinder, and <span class="math inline">\(K_1 \cup K_2 = K\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(|K_1\cap K_2|\)</span> is a circle.
<ol type="a">
<li>Compute all the homologies of <span class="math inline">\(K_1 \cap K_2\)</span> using the definition of homology.</li>
<li>Compute all the homologies of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> using the definition of homology. To represent the homology classes, find cycles induced by the inclusion map of the intersection. You will need to know this for the next part.</li>
<li>Use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute all the homologies of the torus.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This is an alternative way to compute the homologies of <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span>. Each <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span> can be realized as a simplicial complex <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(K = K_1 \cup K_2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K_i\)</span> are sub-complexes of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> whose underlying spaces are each the closed ball of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K_1\cap K_2\)</span> is a subcomplex of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> whose underlying space is <span class="math inline">\(S^{n-1}\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> are acyclic. <em>(For example, if you realize <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span> as the boundary of a simplex, you can realize <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> as cones.)</em> Use that observation along with the Mayer-Vietoris to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\mathrm{H}}_k(S^n) = \tilde{\mathrm{H}}_{k-1}(S^{n-1})\)</span>, thereby allowing you to inductively compute each homology of each <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span>. Notice that reduced homology proved a lot more convenient.</p></li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(f, g : K \to L\)</span> be simplicial maps and <span class="math inline">\(D_k : C_k(K) \to C_{k+1}(L)\)</span> is a map such that <span class="math inline">\(\partial \circ D + D \circ \partial = f_{\#} - g_{\#}\)</span>.
<ol type="a">
<li>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_k(c) := f_{\#}(c) - g_{\#}(c) - D_k (\partial (c))\)</span> is a cycle for any <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>-chain <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and therefore even for an oriented simplex (treated as a chain).</li>
<li>Use the above to prove that if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are carried by an acyclic carrier <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, then one can inductively define a chain homotopy between <span class="math inline">\(f_\#\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_\#\)</span>. The chain homotopy is also carried by <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. <em>(Acyclicity allows you to express <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{k}(c)\)</span> as a boundary of some chain. If you simply define <span class="math inline">\(D_{k+1}\)</span> to be that chain, note that it satisfies the condition for it to be a chain homotopy. You merely have to check that by the definition of an acyclic carrier, that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{k+1}\)</span> is still in an acyclic subcomplex, thereby allowing you to proceed to the next level of induction.)</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(f_1 : |K| \to |L|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2 : |L| \to |M|\)</span> are continuous maps, and <span class="math inline">\(g_1 : K \to L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_2 : L \to M\)</span> their respective simplicial approximates, then prove that <span class="math inline">\(g_2 \circ g_1\)</span> is a simplicial approximate of <span class="math inline">\(f_2 \circ f_1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li>For a simplicial complex <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>,
<ol type="a">
<li>How can you realize <span class="math inline">\(|K|\times [0,1]\)</span> as the polytope of a some simplicial complex <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>?</li>
<li>The inclusion maps <span class="math inline">\(i_0, i_1 : |K| \to |K| \times [0,1]\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(i_0(x) = (x, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i_1(x) = (x, 1)\)</span> are simplicial maps (why?). Prove that their induced maps on the level of chains are chain homotopic. <em>(Hint: There is an obvious acyclic carrier for both maps.)</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Prove that the subdivision of a subdivision of a simplicial complex is a subdivision.</p></li>
<li>Consider a sudivision <span class="math inline">\(K'\)</span> of a simplicial complex <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>
<ol type="a">
<li>Why is the set of points <span class="math inline">\(|K|\)</span> exactly the same set as <span class="math inline">\(|K'|\)</span>?</li>
<li>Why are the topologies of <span class="math inline">\(|K|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|K'|\)</span> the same? <em>(Here is where you will use the fact that each simplex of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a union of finitely many simplices of <span class="math inline">\(K'\)</span>).</em></li>
<li>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a subcomplex of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, then the simplices in <span class="math inline">\(K'\)</span> that lie in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> form a subdivision of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(K'\)</span> is a sub-division of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\theta : K' \to K\)</span> denote the simplicial approximate of the identity map. If <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is a simplex of <span class="math inline">\(K'\)</span> contained in a simplex <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, why is <span class="math inline">\(\theta(\tau)\)</span> also contained in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-simplex of a complex <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> a simplex of a barycentric sub-division of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> that is containied in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{diameter\ of}\ \tau \leq \frac{n}{n+1}\mathrm{diameter\ of}\ \sigma\)</span></p></li>
